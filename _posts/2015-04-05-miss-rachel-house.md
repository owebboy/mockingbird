## Quote 1
> Dill’s hand sought the back of his head. He brought it forward and across his forehead. “We were playin’ strip poker up yonder by the fishpool,” he said.
Jem and I relaxed. The neighbors seemed satisfied: they all stiffened. But what was strip poker?
We had no chance to find out: Miss Rachel went off like the town fire siren: “Do-o-o Jee-sus, Dill Harris! Gamblin’ by my fishpool? I’ll strip-poker you, sir!”

Dill lies to everyone, but gets in even more trouble. This just shows the level of immaturity in the children at the start of the book. This also shows that Dill is a really good liar because he took something really bad, and turned it into something not so bad. Since it took place at Miss Rachel's house, not the Radley's Place.

## Quote 2
> Dill was from Meridian, Mississippi, was spending the summer with his aunt, Miss Rachel, and would be spending every summer in Maycomb from now on. His family was from Maycomb County originally, his mother worked for a photographer in Meridian, had entered his picture in a Beautiful Child contest and won five dollars. She gave the money to Dill, who went to the picture show twenty times on it.

Dill is an interesting character, going from place-to-place, but his home is Miss Rachel's house. Thats what he always thought, and this is shown when he leaves and comes back. Its his home, a simple place with friends and family.
