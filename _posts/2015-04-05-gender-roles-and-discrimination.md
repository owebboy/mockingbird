## Quote 1
> "Scout, I’m tellin’ you for the last time, shut your trap or go home — I declare to the Lord you’re gettin’ more like a girl every day!” With that, I had no option but to join them."

This shows that in the 1930's South, girls were more looked at as fragile and obviously not good enough for Jem. Scout, who know right from wrong, doesn't want to be a "lady", so she just goes with the flow. This womenhood versus childhood battle within Scout's mind and this discrimination that she receives because she's a "tomboy".

## Quote 2
> "[Calpurnia] seemed glad to see me when I appeared in the kitchen, and by watching her I began to think there was some skill involved in being a girl."

This quote is when Scout stops playing with Jem and Dill (because they don't want her), and starts to become a women. This gives her a sense of responsibility and accepts that she isn't a man, but a women. Although, she still is more free-spirited and liberal than any other women.
