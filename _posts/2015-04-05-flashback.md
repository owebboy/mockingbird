## Example 1
> Cecil Jacobs made me forget. He had announced in the schoolyard the day before that Scout Finch’s daddy defended niggers. I denied it, but told Jem.
“What’d he mean sayin’ that?” I asked.
“Nothing,” Jem said. “Ask Atticus, he’ll tell you.”
“Do you defend niggers, Atticus?” I asked him that evening.
“Of course I do. Don’t say nigger, Scout. That’s common."
...
“With this in mind, I faced Cecil Jacobs in the schoolyard next day: “You gonna take that back, boy?”
“You gotta make me first!” he yelled. “My folks said your daddy was a disgrace an’ that nigger oughta hang from the water-tank!”
I drew a bead on him, remembered what Atticus had said, then dropped my fists and walked away, “Scout’s a cow—ward!” ringing in my ears. It was the first time I ever walked away from a fight.”

This is all about Scout changing from a hot-headed lunatic that beats everyone up into a mature girl who puts Atticus' wishes above her own. Scout and Jem are both growing up thanks to the town's racism. Also, this gives a view into the minds of Maycomb. It is uncommon for a white man to help a black man. This just shows the problem of mob mentality, and that Atticus wants his children to learn to think for themselves.

## Example 2
>“Things did settle down, after a fashion, as Atticus said they would. By the middle of October, only two small things out of the ordinary happened to two Maycomb citizens. No, there were three things, and they did not directly concern us—the Finches—but in a way they did.
The first thing was that Mr. Bob Ewell acquired and lost a job in a matter of days and probably made himself unique in the annals of the nineteen-thirties: he was the only man I ever heard of who was fired from the WPA for laziness. I suppose his brief burst of fame brought on a briefer burst of industry, but his job lasted only as long as his notoriety: Mr. Ewell found himself as forgotten as Tom Robinson. ”

This flashback is all about Bob Ewell and how he was basically done after the trial. He got fired from The Works Progress Administration, which employed millions of unemployed folks during the Great Depression, for laziness. This just shows that he wants the benefits without the consequences.
