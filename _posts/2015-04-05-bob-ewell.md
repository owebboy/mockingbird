## Quote 1
> “I seen that black nigger yonder ruttin’ on my Mayella!”

Bob is bad; within this sentence he completely lies about what happened on the farm. Basically, he says that Tom Robinson raped Mayella, when in fact, Tom makes the case that Mayella came on him. This is how Bob wins the case, it's a black man's word against a white man's.

## Quote 2
> “Why, I run for Tate quick as I could. I knowed who it was, all right, lived down yonder in that nigger-nest, passed the house every day. Jedge, I’ve asked this county for fifteen years to clean out that nest down yonder, they’re dangerous to live around ’sides devaluin’ my property—”

Bob Ewell is the scum of the earth. He hates his "colored" neighbors, and probably his white neighbors too. Which is casued by the fact that he is too poor to be liked by the white folk. To get back at them, he bullies the black folk, since he has too be better than somebody.
