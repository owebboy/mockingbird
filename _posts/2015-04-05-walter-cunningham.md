##	 Quote 1
> “Don’t you remember me, Mr. Cunningham? I’m Jean Louise Finch. You brought us some hickory nuts one time, remember?” I began to sense the futility one feels when unacknowledged by a chance acquaintance.
“I go to school with Walter,” I began again. “He’s your boy, ain’t he? Ain’t he, sir?”
Mr. Cunningham was moved to a faint nod. He did know me, after all.

Mr. Cunningham is cool. He doesn't tell Scout that she has no business talking 'bout his son, in fact, he wants to know what she has to say. This shows that he respects whom he's trying to hurt, which contradicts the whole point of his venture to the jail. He's really a good guy, just doesn't know what's going on.

## Quote 2
> “What’s the matter?” I asked.
Atticus said nothing. I looked around and up at Mr. Cunningham, whose face was equally impassive. Then he did a peculiar thing. He squatted down and took me by both shoulders.
“I’ll tell him you said hey, little lady,” he said.
They he straightened up and waved a big paw. “Let’s clear out,” he called. “Let’s get going, boys.”

Scout has gotten to Walter, he know understands that he isn't doing a very good thing, and he becomes a leader right here, right now. He removes his posse from the situation. He compares Atticus' family with his own, thanks to Scout. He then says the only thing he says throughout the novel, "I'll tell him tou said hey, little lady." This is brilliant on Lee's part, she gives this character a chance to regain himself by his actions, not so much his words. Which I think is kind've reminiscent of the time period. If you want to change the world from a Great Depression, you can't talk about it, you gotta do somethin.

## Walter's Philosophy
- Ignorance can cause violence
- Minds can be changed through those with experience
- Don't screw the system
- Take care of your own family
- Forgive and move on
- Set an example for your chillin and yo fellow man
- Help the people that helped you
- Don't take unless you give in return
- Be a leader
- Do the right thing
